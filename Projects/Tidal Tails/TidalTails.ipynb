    "A tidal tail is a thin, elongated region of matter that extends into space from a galaxy. Since the time scale for formation of these objects is very long, the numerical solution must be appropiately scaled. Using a set of units such that the heavy masses have masses of 1 unit and G = 1 solved this issue. A Verlet integrator was chosen as it is symplectic and hence conserves energy and momentum well. This is very important in gravitational problems as the energy defines the trajectory of interacting masses. The Verlet algorithm is as follows:\n",
    "1. Calculate the position vector after one time step using another integration method such as 4th order Runge-Kutta\n",
    "2. Use the following equation for the nth step:\n",
    "<center>$\\mathbf{r}_{n+1} = 2\\mathbf{r}_n-\\mathbf{r}_{n-1}+\\Delta t^2 \\mathbf{a}(\\mathbf{r}_n)$</center>\n",
