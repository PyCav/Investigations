    "#### Setup\n",
    "A double pendulum comprises two point masses $m_1$ and $m_2$ joined by rigid, light struts of lengths $l_1$ and $l_2$. The struts are joined by a frictionless hinge which constrains the masses to move in a vertical plane. The upper strut is attached by another frictionless hinge to a support and the massess hang below in a uniform gravitational field $g$. The state of the system can be expressed by the angles $\\theta_1$ and $\\theta_2$ which the struts make with the vertical."
