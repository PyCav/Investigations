    "First, you have to decide how to deal with the 3-dimensional vector fields, both for the position and magnetic field vectors. Most simply, you can have three arrays representing the Cartesian $x$, $y$ and $z$ components of the vectors. Or you could use a [class](https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/classes.html) or structure that represents a point in 3-space, and use a vector of such points. A 4-dimensional array (or higher-dimensional as required) where three of the dimensions correspond to x, y and z respectively may be the way forward. The choice is yours."

    "You then need to think about how to represent the wire. I recommend that you write a program that is general, i.e. that can calculate the field due to an arbitrary wire. You could define the wire by a set of $N$ line segments defined by $N + 1$ points in space, each section of wire running from $(x_i, \\ y_i, \\ z_i)$ to $(x_{i+1}, \\ y_{i+1}, z_{i+1})$, i.e. from $\\textbf{r}_i$ to $\\textbf{r}_{i+1}$ using vectors."
